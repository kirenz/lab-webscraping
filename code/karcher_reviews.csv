I had difficulty finding the parts I needed using the online illustrated catalogue. Ultimately I had to call the support number and the agent I spoke to agreed that it was difficult to identify parts because the picture index numbers didn't match the descriptions in the part listings. Ultimately I ordered the parts that resolved my problem but I didn't have confidence that what I ordered was what I needed.,3,tomd514,7 days ago

"Shopping online we easy and efficient. However, the product leaks water all over. Seem when I turn on the pressure washer, the handle leak/sprays water on me. I tried to buy a new handle from you folks, but later you canceled the order.. Weird..  I think the O rings in the handle can't handle the 3,000 psi. need fix..!",4,Andy,10 days ago
"I was able to purchase the unit. I was interested online without much of an issue. However, I originally ordered the wrong unit, I contacted Carter within a day, and they advised you were unable to assist. Ultimately, I had to order a second unit and ship the original one back. This put the cost of two rather expensive power washers on my credit card, and one of them has still not been taken off and it's been over 10 days. Hopefully this will be resolved shortly.The unit was delivered in good working condition with no issues whatsoever and precisely as ordered. So overall, please, the quality of the product delivered promptly was just unfortunate. Their customer service could not accommodate the switch.",4,jayf901,10 days ago

"Shopped around for the best stick vac and found one here. It's very powerful vs. others; lightweight and easy to use; relatively quiet (I expected it to be louder, honestly). It is picking up dust bunnies I can't see and I love that. I wish I could find a wider ""head"" for hardwood (I have a lot of them). I found a 20-something inch for my corded vac I use. It won't fit this though. That is my only issue. It's great on stairs, rugs, and sofas. Great in the bathroom and for baseboards with the brush head. Very pleased.",5,Cleanfreak,a month ago

I had previously purchased a K1700 power washer. Your website accessories section listed Items for K2-K5 power washers. Where does a K1700 fit into the K2-K5 designations?

"I needed to replace the garden hose coupling for my power washer, a machine many years old and actually no longer in inventory. We use the machine 2 to 3 times a year, but when we use it is is for large jobs that take several days. Again, we have used it over the last ten years, at least. And have let others borrow it. I give this information because they build machines to last. Just run them dry, change the oil occasionally, and use real gasoline without ethanol. Anyway, the part was $3.96 and it came postage free in two days. Excellent!",5,Excellent,2 months ago

It took about 30 minutes on the phone to get the return process going, and now over a day later still unsure if it’s going anywhere? No return label or correspondence from them. Not too unusual from a company these days, but a little ridiculous from one who boasts a “rapid return program.” I’m sure it will eventually work out but I am regretting my purchase as of now.",3,Bied559,2 months ago

"Only downside was long wait for product availability but delivery was very quick and the floor has never been cleaner. Mopping was leaving a lot of dirt behind, not the case with this machine. I can run a damp paper towel over cleaned area and it isn’t showing any dirt. You do have to empty dirty tank often it’s worth it. Important to note I have 1800 so feet of vinyl flooring and it was frustrating to see floor still not clean after mopping. Unit stays charged has promised, I just need to clean my floors in sections at a time due to so many square feet of flooring we have. But I know my floor will get cleaned more often due to no back breaking mop cleaning. My hope is to get many yrs use due to pricy unit, taking care to clean after ea use will I’m sur help with long use. No regrets on my purchase.",5,Ly67,3 months ago

Very disappointed twice the ladies I talked to hung up on me I bought my sweeper November 30th got it December 4th broke March 10th I bought a new charger didn’t work! It’s under a 1 year warranty and I purchased a 2 year warranty through Walmart! Walmart said I have to have Karcher fix or replace it! Why should I have to fight to get my sweeper replaced it’s not the charger either! I love my sweeper but I’m highly disappointed in Karcher! I paid $24 with shipping for the charger then another $43 I had buy another little sweeper because I needed one! I let a bill go to buy these 2! $67!,1,Susie,3 months ago

I used to have a Dyson but it was heavy and did  work great. I compared this to that and there are a number things I prefer the Kärcher over the other. The 3 speed options are great. Allows me to decide clean vs length of time I can operate   The run times are dead on. It works well on carpet and wood floor. Really like it especially for the price. I also bought an Emerson version at Costco and returned it after about 2 days. It was junk. Price to performance ratio is very nice on this unit.,5,Really impressed,7 months ago

I have had the sweeper for 7 years and should have replaced the brushes earlier, one still was in pretty good condition, so I waited.

If I go into my account and review my orders, it doesn´t even show  that the shipment has been shipped. That´s a very poor service and nothing I´d expected from a company like Karcher.

"Goal: Purchase a pressure washer with a surface cleaner from the siteHurdles: I created my online account, added my items and attempted to check out. After submitting credit card details, the system displayed the wait indicator while presumably, the credit details were checked. But the wait was infinite. Over several days and multiple attempts per day, the system would accept credit details and not communicate back to the user that there were downstream issues.Resolution: At a minimum the site should never wait indefinitely on a response from any downstream system. All requests should be timed and communication with the user is paramount when a collaborating system is not behaving. This is where this site fails.On the positive, the items were not deleted from my cart. The issue was ultimately resolved after conferring with customer support.",2,Hillside Valley,a year ago

This is a nice machine.  I am happy with the upgrade from the K5 model.  The arms to wrap the electrical cord up makes it easy to store.  The hose wheel is also functional.

UPS dropped the box and dented the unit. Its a small dent that doesnt affect anything but UPS dented my wonderful new preasure washer.  Hose reel and power cord storage is way better than older models. The storage box hold spare tips and cleaning brush. I like this better than the 1600psu I just replaced.,5,Bill,a year ago
After first use and pulling the power washer hose out off of the reel when trying to put it away the handle does not reel in the hose.  It does not turn the reel as if stripped or something.  After inspecting the power washer I am a little concerned that the hose may be attached to motor via something I can't see and hope not issue if need replacing.  The supplied connection to the house hose leaks not sure if that is way designed or what.  The power washer does doe a good job cleaning.,2,TimS,a year ago

I had to call multiple times and different numbers to end with me having to complete the sale by myself online, ridiculous! Also I received a confirmation email showing that my order was received and explained that my order would usually ship out in 2-3 days and I’d receive another email after my order shipped with the shipping information, which I still haven’t received.However I did receive the email asking me about my experience with Kärcher.

"Shopping was easy, delivery of goods took 8 days from date of order while it was shipped the next day.Unfortunately, there was a packing mistake and I did not receive all necessary and correct parts for the product. Due to the missing parts I cannot test the product before going on a longer trip to see if I am satisfied with the product and want to keep it. A request to customer service to extend the 30 day return period in this case since it was not my mistake that it takes more than 2 weeks from the day of ordering to the day I will be able to use the product was denied by the Kaercher Customer Service, and in case I want to return it before my trip, I would have to pay for return shipping what's quite substantial due to the package size.I am very unsatisfied with the customer service provided by Kaercher and would recommend buying the product from other sellers.No comment on the product itself since I wasn't able to use it, yet.",2,W Woods,2 years ago

You switched the k1900 to the K1900ps saying it was an upgraded newer model It is not. So for the same price and even though I offered to pay more you didn't allow that.

"The delivery arrived on the date promised - Good. The box was delivered upside down, with the tape split and the box flaps open. I spoke with UPS and they said that they are not responsible for the sender's packaging. This makes sense. The box, with a 40 pound vacuum in it, was taped with one strip of tape along the long seam. And, while there is a piece of cardboard at the bottom of the package, there are punch-outs for the wheels. For the cost of this unit, NT 40/1 Tact Te, more tape and something to spread the load (rather than point-loading at the wheels), seams worth it. As it turns out, after pouring over ever piece for damage (that I can see), both the stainless steel suction tubes are dented/bent. I can only hope that Karcher will replace the suction tubes, and take a good look at how you prepare a large heavy tool for shipping across the country. Tape and cardboard costs less than an unhappy customer and the replacement of two suction tubes. - Whether or not I would shop ""here"" again depends on what happens next. As of now it is an open question.",2,ShippingDamageNT40 1,2 years ago

"After several days waiting for it to ship, my unit arrived having been speared by a forklift fork and severely damaged. A replacement unit is supposedly on the way. Customer service was clunky at best. After a few dropped/disconnected calls, multiple transfers, and several different phone numbers I was able to speak with someone who promised to send me a return label and a replacement unit, ""a little later"". It sounded like she was working remotely and not at her desk.  We'll see if they make good on it.",2,Kevin,2 years ago

After UPS talked to Karcher who probably told them to open the container and see if anything was blemished inside and if not send it on I received the item. I immediately tested the unit to see if the motor still functioned, miraculously it did.The box was no longer square it was round.It had been opened by someone. If I was Karcher I would have replaced it immediately and preserved my good standing with my customers, they made their position abundantly clear.If the power washer continues to function it will at least attest to the quality of the unit.",3,judd55,2 years ago

"My 20+ year old Karcher power washer died recently.  Based on the great performance, I planned to replace it with a Karcher.  The local dealer did not have stock on the models I wanted to I went to the Karcher store online.  I ordered and received in 3 days- great.  The washer arrived with all packaging intact, but the manual and spray wand are missing (never packaged).  I contacted Karcher and was told they would ship these two items.   Manual was received promptly.  Called again on the spray wand to be told this is on back order, and no idea when it will ship?   Requested they expedite one from the factory and told not an option.  It's 19 days later and the washer would be idle if up to Karcher.  I went online and Home Depot had Karcher wand and shipped promptly at my added cost.  Karcher could have found the part and fixed the issue, but would do nothing extra to resolve the issue.",1,Disappointed22,2 years ago

I was not in rush, and I thought it would be better if I buy it from the manufacturer. Well, I was not in rush but I needed it this weekend, and I did not consider that it would take 2 whole weeks to receive the item, because I believed the shipping info provided to me while I was ordering it even with the acceptable margin of error, it was ok. So, what did I learn? Do not buy anything from Karcher website, just drive to Home Depot and buy whatever brand, whatever they got.",1,Kzr1237,2 years ago

The UPS delivery to my home was on time as promised and the setup of the new pressure washer simple and well explained in the documentation.

Terrific products but a real challenge trying to place an order on your website.You can't delete an item in the shopping cart.

So thus shopping experience has Gus's approval for sure!  And all the other things that I need to make sound extra special and that this was amazing and best ever experience!  All that!  Did I mention Gus loves the shipping box and packaging materials as well!  Ready for a non 75°+ day with a frosty morning to be able to scrape the ice off our driveway!!If you have any customer needs make sure to have Gertie help you out!  GERTIE Is amazing and definitely has the knowledge and experience to get the shipping and other necessity of it all happening and taken care of when you need!  Thanks for the extra care and compassion in handling my order and needs with the shipment!  But when it comes down to the shipping Bruce handles the packaging and organizational aspects of getting your package delivered in a timely manner, and most importantly that your order arrives in the same condition as when it was placed into the box!  So today we salute a real hero Bruce!  And most importantly over everything we need to send a shout out to the lawyers!  Without the assistance of the legal team, this package that Gertie, Bruce,  (I think that even Mark from accounting helped get it to me) and especially Reginald, (last name with held for legal reasons)  Esquire,  has made sure that this was the utmost of importance to make sure that the Patterson case was put on hold so the package and contents were able to clear any loopholes and legal potholes in shipment to me.  I should also clarify...  don't write reviews for awesome products when having edibles and a bottle of wine!But seriously!  You guys did great!",5,Gus and Nate,3 years ago

"I must have caught the website in the middle of updates after the Labor Day sale in the US.  The sale was extended but the prices changed to the non sale prices then back and forth for a day or two.  Thought it was my browser but it wasn’t after I verified on a few different systems and browser types.  When the prices were corrected I quickly added item and checked out.  The checkout purchasing process is not anything I have seen before, not standard in the US for certain.  I attributed this to possibly a EU experience that was utilized worldwide.  But it wasn’t normal for any mobile purchase that I have ever seen.  Might want to work on that a bit.",3,BillM,3 years ago

"I would say that my shopping experience is below average.1) The website navigation is easy, finding all I need and payment was smooth. But then it all starts. 2) The order waited two times longer than it was stated in ""usually ships in 2-5 days"". It took 10 days and my email to have the order shipped. The website is not very informative regarding the order state. The order is already received, yet the order status on the website is not even switched to ""shipped"". 3) The device came with dislocated front panel. It was literally half-inch hole on the top and a bunch of small parts fell inside the device. I spent more than an hour on the phone trying to reach out to support. Absolutely no success, just endless waiting, and random hang-ups, and no other options to reach them out. Thank God, nothing was broken, and Kaercher is not a modern kind of device that is designed with intent to prevent them from being serviced. I am also not an all-thumb person, so I disassembled that, recovered all fallen apart pieces, and assembled the device properly. Kudos to engineers as well, it is a nicely designed device. I have no problems at all understanding the way it is made. A couple of hours more in my workshop after 10 days of waiting and so I have a perfectly working device and three shiny clean cars outside. This is why I rate it 3, at least I have what I bought and it works perfectly. Sorry, Kaercher. You make great devices but have a mediocre purchase expirience. If you improve that, you'll be simply the best vendor on the market.",3,nowhereman,3 years ago

Your website is hard to navigate.  This is the fourth order I've received.  Parts don't work/fit even though your site says they will fit.  First we received two orders of O Rings for our trigger handle.  Both were the same incorrect size part.  Next we ordered the hose trigger with an adapter included.  These connected to the power washer.  Did not connect to the spray tip.  Next we ordered the adapter from the trigger sprayer to the spray tip.  Again did not fit.,1,Disappointed,3 years ago

"Customer service is great!  The product is awesome. I just wish a smaller version was made for apartment dwellers.  I can see how this design works wonderfully for long driveways and sidewalks and even a garage.  It keeps the dust from blowing up in your face while you clean.  For large 2nd story patios, this can be a challenge because the sweeper/dust bin motion doesn’t get a chance to really pick up the rest.  However, the design is one of the best I have seen.",4,Punky,3 years ago

"Received the order very quickly and the customer service team is great. However, there are a few comments in terms of room for improvement. First, the order confirmation email stated that a link would be sent to track the order. I did not receive a link and received an email with only a PDF copy of the shipping confirmation, no text or explanation as to what was sent. It was not easily determinable as to how to track the shipment. I would suggest to revise the shipping confirmation email by providing a written explanation as to what was sent and a link to track the shipment, following a similar type of format as the order confirmation email. That will also help reduce calls to your customer service team in regards to shipping.Also, when I received the the package for my steamer, the box was not in good shape at all. So much so as to where I saw a component of a steamer protruding from the box. Not sure if it was from storage at Karcher or if it may have been the shipper, but it was a bit of a surprise. I was concerned of the integrity of the steamer given the exterior condition of the box. Everything seems okay, but the components inside the box were dusty and a few pieces have some cosmetic exterior damage.I also ordered a vacuum, of which the box was in good shape. All seems good, but I did notice a bit of cosmetic exterior damage to the vacuum itself.Hopefully this feedback is helpful!",3,BMW1,3 years ago

Of course, it’s saved me the angst of fretting over items sitting in a carrier facility for as long as 72 hours due to recent bad storms.

After inspecting bag where extra nozzles came in there wasn't a missing piece . Found it unusual that this got through quality control.May have been an oversight I called the 1800537-4129 and the customer service agent stated they would send me out a replacement package of nozzles. She was a bit non-congenial as if my statement was disingenuous. As I was about to ask her another question she ended the call abruptly.

Says 5+ has improved suction, but no specifics. No details on the solutions or specific differences and uses. No details on the differences between rollers. Some have yellow, gray or blue? stripes  Is there a difference?I like the the cleaner. It was dripping some dirty water on the floor after 30 minutes use. Haven’t figured out where it is coming from. Dirty water tank isn’t leaking. I would buy this again. Only good linear style floor cleaner I’ve found. 2500 SWFT of bamboo to clean.",5,Bamboo,4 years ago

"I've bought everything on the site that I thought might give me a single jet of high-pressure water, but nothing works. The wand that came with the unit is only a ""fan"" spray and even the right-angle wand produces a fan spray though smaller. The extension that the patio cleaning unit comes with also does nothing to give a high-pressure jet. I owned Karchers in France for 15 years and ALL of them produced a high-pressure narrow jet. How can I get an attachment (not shown under the model) that will produce a narrow JET of water???",3,JOCL,4 years ago

"The first person I talked to a week before I placed my order was not helpful at all. However when I did call to place my order the woman I spoke to was extremely helpful with my questions about the part and explained that I would indeed need the adapter for my Dirt Blaster, and I was happy that she was able to confirm that this part had a 90 day warranty. I placed my order on your website and that went very well. I am happy with the performance so far and glad to know that Karcher will stand behind it for 90 days if it fails.",4,GaryO,4 years ago

Found Obsessed Garage on YouTube and Matt spoke highly of the K1700 Cube pressure washer and the three year warranty sold me on the spot. Was outside yesterday and used the K1700 Cube pressure washer for over five hours and couldn't be happier.

"I purchased a K5 Premium, unused and still in the box, from a private party.  I ordered online two FJ6 Foam Nozzles to help in my car detailing hobby.   I've never wanted to use an electric sprayer, thinking my gas powered one would do everything I needed.  However, it was too much for the new foam products becoming popular in the car maintenance field.  This sprayer is fantastic.  I bought two foam guns so I can keep solutions in the containers, thus avoiding rinsing and refilling.  As long as there's power to the pump, I'm sold on the Karcher concept.  It's quieter, uses less water than my larger gas power washer (and washing using a garden hose), easier to clean up afterward, and simpler to use.    I took too long to get over my ""dislike"" of trying an electric as the Karcher.  I should have done this years ago.  It compliments my big-daddy-gas washer perfectly.                Customer service was excellent when purchasing the foam guns.  I needed them faster than usual and staff made it possible to get them to me in Oregon within a week.  Thanks.",5,Tim W,4 years ago

"My experience is... while the price for the Karcher power washer was good, I ordered on June 19th and still have not received the item yet as of July 1, 2020.    I did get an email on June 29th regarding the shipment going out on June 26th.....but it still has not arrived.  I almost deleted this email without reading as it appeared to be spam in that it was sent from an unknown person and a strange spelling of Karcher as opposed to a normal .com email address. A tracking number for the shipment would have been nice to have as well. Shipping times are long and communications with customers need to be stepped up  IMO.",3,DSYNOVA,4 years ago

"I needed to replace the hose of a K-5 with the hose reel. Could not find the precise part number that is specified in the Accessories booklet that came with the washer, on the Karcher site. Bought the K-5 25-foot replacement hose and got the free wheel brush, much appreciated. But the box said it would not work with the K5 with reel. After hunting, I could not find any other solution. So I removed the hose reel, removed the circlips holding the hose coupling/bearing, and was able to connect all the hoses back, the system works fine. I wonder if there is some work-around to get the Quick-connect hose coupling to work with the reel: it has to go through a tight space. I didn't want to cut that open before verifying that I could get it to work. Much appreciate the service from this washer, which followed my purchase of a less powerful Karcher washer decades ago, which also saw extensive service. Thanks",4,Bubba,4 years ago

"Ordered the 1900 model and got it very quickly. The problem was that it did not work. Called the warranty dept and explained that the motor would not go to full speed. I even put my cell phone next to the unit so she could hear it. She then asked me what length water hose I was using. Said I had a 50 ft. She told me that was my problem. I could only have a 25 ft hose hooked up. Told her that no where in the manual it says that, you only need a 5/8 diameter minimum. Said I wanted to return it if that was the case. I even hooked up a 15 ft hose and it still did not work. I then called customer care and the young lady said she had never heard that. So they reordered me a new one. I have a 330 model that I have had for 20 years and wanted to upgrade. Will follow up when I get the replacement. I hope this one works.",3,Bob1946,4 years ago

I ordered a K3 Follow Me pressure washer for my son and incorrectly processed the online order. I contacted customer service by email and received an immediate response. I have been a Kärcher customer since 1986 and love Kärcher product quality and customer service.  Their recent response for my last two orders demonstrates their commitment to residential and commercial users.

"There are so many reviews of companies that advertised variety of different type of pressure washers, Because I had  Karcher K 2.89 for 7 years until the pressure pump went out. It was a good pressure washer except the pressure hose was very stiff and couldn't rolled up properly.  I decided to purchased Karcher K 1700 1.2 gpm.  I primarily used it for car washing and did a good job.  At the same time, I was disappointed that the pressure hose is still stiff and almost impossible to roll up around the handle or in the bucket.  I am looking to purchase a replacement flexible pressure hose but I read some reviews that the flexible hose can crack or burst open! Unless you want to purchase an reliable expensive flexible pressure hose, I recommended it only if you can stand the stiff pressure hose.",4,Pedrocky,4 years ago

"Shipped in 3 days. Arrived on time. Worked fine for about 4 hours then DIED. I'm in the process of starting a warranty exchange. I will update the review with how quick and smooth that process went. Now I have a half done walkway and my plans for finishing the entire patio, walkway and house on hold when I had free time. Overall I was VERY happy with the unit. It's thoughtfully designed, the connections are all quality and the unit was powerful enough for small to medium jobs. I'm hoping the replacement lasts many years because for about 4 hours I was very happy, now I'm very sad. The motor unit appears to have had a seal failure. When I released the trigger the motor kept running and i looked back at the unit and water was leaking at an aggressive rate from the motor unit area behind the plastic shrouds.",1,Theredbaron48,4 years ago

"I did my research and chose Karcher K5 premium pressure washer. By purchasing on the website, I received the bonus right angle wand. I was very excited to receive my package In 7days. The Karcher K5 box did not look new. The outside of the box was damaged and it couldn’t come from the delivery service. I opened the box and all the parts was not packaged neatly, it looked like someone threw all parts in the box. There was no foam protection on top only on the bottom.I took out the main body of the power washer and examined the outside structure. On the front of the power washer on the bottom. The main foot stand was broken off the structure. This foot piece look like it was molded with the main front cover. I was very disappointed with this package. I immediately called Karcher warranty department and explained what happened. They immediately looked up the part and said it was in stock. They will send it out as soon as possible. I am hoping able to dissemble the power washer and replaced the piece with no hassle. I have not tried the K5 premium, due to broken piece, but I am eager to use it right away and see it’s performance. I am hoping, I will not have any other issues with the power washer. I would hope the distributor In the future would check the box and make sure they are not shipping a unorganized/ unprotected product before shipment to the receiver.Overall the box looked opened previously and resealed with clear tape and plastic straps. The product looked new.  I would shop here again, due to product  performance  and customer service.",3,Jeff K,4 years ago

We sweep up all the time and it does a great job on fine sand, garlic skin to whole almonds.

"What a little gem this electric broom is! We live in a 1200 square foot, two bedroom, two bath apartment with a cat and dog. There is very low pile carpeting in the bedrooms, hallway, living area, dining area, and between the kitchen stove and center island, where the sink and garbage can are. The rest of the floors are hardwood, and tile in the bathrooms. This product picks up everything from every one of those surfaces. I use it three to four times daily, and charge it during the night while we are sleeping. My only wish is for a battery with a longer operating time, say 60 minutes instead of 30.

This rating is only for the shopping experience and offers no opinion about product performance. Use of the website and payment system was easy and completed with no problems. Several after sale emails were received to confirm order and then to advise on delivery progress. Delivery was received within the promised window.  Product packaging was in good condition at time of delivery. One part was found to be broken dining the unboxing / assembly process. Unable to determine if broken part was a result of manufacturing or shipping. Customer Service agent had a great deal of difficulty identifying the broken part and left me on hold for over 20 minutes. Replacement part has not arrived yet and I don’t have high expectation that I will be receiving the correct part.,4,Nprvl,4 years ago
Shopping was easy and product descriptions were clear.  I received my order promptly.

"I placed an order for a Premium floor scrubber and received a confirmation that indicated my order should ship within 2 or 3 business days.  When it hadn't shipped in over a week, I called several times to inquire about the delay. Each time I received a repetitive recorded message advising me that all representatives were assisting other customers. Eventually I got another message telling me that my call could not be completed and to leave a voice mail or send an email. No one responded to the voice mail, so I gave up and cancelled my order. Very poor customer service.",1,JamesK,5 years ago
"Very disappointed with the service. Ordered my steamer online on 11/25/2019, today is 12/07/2019 and the steamer still didn’t arrive. In the order description it was stated that the purchase will arrive in 3 business days. I have to move to a new house and the time frame is essential for me. I had to call 4-5 times I used several different phone numbers provided on the website. Only once I spoke with the representative who informed me that she doesn’t have an access to the purchases made online and that I have to go back and leave a voicemail. Which I already did 2 times. Very poor communication. There is more, now on the website Kärcher offers $30 discounts on the steamer I bought. So I didn’t get a discount and I still don’t have my steamer!!!! Outrageous!!!!",1,Julia27,5 years ago

But, all the parts were there and undamaged, so I took a chance and assembled it.  Assembly was easy and once I reviewed the basic instructions I was up and running. Absolutely incredible results on my grout with the small round grout attachment/brush. Very happy so far. Hopefully it lasts a good long while. I do agree with other reviewers that some kind of cord storage solution would be helpful, but I'm just going to find an appropriately sized plastic tub and store all of the parts in there.",4,sparky,5 years ago

"Order received quickly, but part did not fit my pressure washer. After several phone calls (call back line could never get thru, and referred to another number for commercial customers. These people however are unable to  look up order numbers from karcher.com so this was frustrating and waste of time. Turns out ordertree had same part much cheaper, but both incorrect for my model number. Very nice person (VPruitt)  was able to find part I needed. It appears that Karcher delivered my refurbished G 2600 VH-R with trigger assembly from different model which led to parts discrepancy. (I am original owner)",3,MaDD,5 years ago

There were a few unflattering reviews, but I could read between the lines and went ahead with the purchase based on the enthusiasm of others.  I seems very clear to me now that the bulk of the low star reviews came from people who failed to read the instruction manual before using the appliance.  The instructions are very clear, and if you follow them, the floor cleaner works as advertised.  It really does a nice, streak-less job, with a lot less effort than traditional mopping.  The floor was dry in two minutes as promised.",5,Satisfied 007,5 years ago

Called them and took pictures to send and they said they would send another unit but let's just hope it is inspected before it is packaged.  We had good luck in the past with this brand but never thought we would receive a unit in this condition.  Still waiting on the replacement and hope they begin to look at their items very good before they are shipped.  The customer service lady was very nice and said a new one will be on it's way very shortly......let's just hope it is right.",1,Robert,5 years ago

"The Only reason I gave this purchase only two stars IS because the new K4 power washer has changed hose connections from my old K3.  I have two 25FT hose extensions that I cannot use!  This is because you make NO adapters for the K4 quick connect to the old M22 connectors.   What is WORSE though,  you sell NO hose extensions in the newer quick connect fittings in the USA!!!  I talked with your customer support (which IS very HARD to contact live person)  they new of NO solution to help me.  Which means I have a power washer that is limited to the length of the power cord and the length of  the hose wand.  You recommend not to use  an electrical power cord.   After extensive searching on the internet, I did manage to find hose extensions for the K4..... BUT they were from sellers overseas, and would NOT ship to USA !!!  How Frustrating is that???Why Would YOU market Hose extension in Quick Connect in Europe and elsewhere,  But NOT in the USA???The power washer works well, But I can't use it like I used my old K3.Karcher.... You Dropped the the Ball on your american customers!!",2,G W 66,5 years ago

The website does not give any number to call for private residential orders so any attempt to contact the seller were useless except for email.Hopefully now everything is ok, but for sure customer service is not addressed properly.",3,Kikka,5 years ago
"I ordered three items directly from Karcher. A power washer, hard surface cleaner and a window/glass cleaner. First item to show up at my door was the power washer. It looked like it had been dropped out of the back of a moving delivery truck. Mangled box with holes and missing pieces. I under that it’s out of there hands once the delivery company takes over but apparently the advertisement on the outside of the box is more important than the safe delivery of a product. If they had only placed the boxed washer in a heavy shipment cardboard box, it would have arrived in good condition. I tried to contact Karcher multiple times and either had a dead end recording or a worker with a complete lack of knowledge regarding the resolution. Item two, the hard surface cleaner. Opened the box only to find that it was either a return or someone at the factory removed the cleaning brushes. This was the premium model meant to have two sets of brushes. It had the machine, broken styrofoam and nothing more. As far as the window cleaner goes. It seems complete other than it being in a generic white box that mimics a refurbished unit.  As I mentioned, I made multiple (8) attempts to resolve this but had less than satisfactory results.  At this point I’m not looking forward to call number 9.  I will be requesting three return labels and will chalk this up as a learning experience. If I’m lucky enough to have positive results and Karcher can keep me as a customer then that would be welcomed.",1,KevGreg,5 years ago

Unfortunately I was not able to use it because of 3 quality issues were found.  1) The hi pressure hose on the hose reel was severely kinked. 2) the clear hose for the detergent bottle was severely kinked and 3) the retaining clip to connect the hose was missing. :-( I called customer service and they good about sending out replacements which will take about 5-6days. So it will be about 2 weeks before I can turn it on to see how it works. The one thing that I can say at this point is that the design, fit and finish is very well thought out.",3,AK RK,5 years ago

I had few electric power washers but I should have save and get this one instead years before.  We have cold winters so I just need to remember to winterize it as one of my electric ones got destroyed by winter.  I could not find assembly instructions but it was only few screws that needed to be screw in to get the wheels and handle on.

I have been using Karcher electric brooms for years. I stopped a few years ago because the new ones I purchased didn't last that long and they got very expensive to replace. I checked them out a few weeks ago and saw that their price was comparable to years ago when I purchased last. I purchased four for my Bed and Breakfast. We use them when guests are staying more than one night and we tidy up the room. They are fantastic for quick pick ups without having to lug around a heavy vacuum and deal with the cord. They pick up surprising well for their size. My staff is very happy to have Karcher electric brooms again.,5,1795AcornInn,5 years ago
